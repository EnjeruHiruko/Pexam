Scene x2 – Standard Action
Effect: Connection – Dragon Darts. The user places two Dreepy Tokens within 6m. The user may move all Dreepy Tokens it controls 4m as a Swift Action. A Dreepy Token can freely enter other creatures’ squares as part of this movement, which destroys the token, and causes the creature to suffer an AC2 DB 5 Physical Dragon-Type attack as if from the user of Missile Launch. Dreepy Tokens may be targeted. They have the same evasions as the user, and any damage destroys them (including from Smite damage).
Ability: Neutralizing Gas
Static
Effect: Abilities may not be Triggered in a burst 1 around the user, and Defensive abilities do not function in that area (the user is unaffected by this). If the user uses Poison Gas, Smog, Clear Smog, or Strange Steam, targets hit by those Moves may not trigger Abilities or benefit from Defensive abilities for one full round.
Ability: Pastel Veil
Static
Effect: The user and allies within 3 meters cannot be Poisoned or Badly Poisoned. Defensive.
Ability: Perish Body
Daily – Standard Action, Reaction
Trigger: The user is hit with a Melee attack
Effect: The triggering creature and the user each receive a Perish Count of 3. At the beginning of each of the target’s turns, their Perish count is lowered by 1. Once a Perish Count reaches 0, set the Pokémon’s Hit Points to 0. A Perish Count disappears if a target returns to their Poké Ball, Takes a Breather, or is knocked out. Perish Body never causes Massive Damage. Defensive.
Ability: Power Spot
Static
Effect: Allies within 2m of the user gain a +5 bonus to damage rolls.
Ability: Propeller Tail
Scene – Swift Action
Effect: The user may make a Sprint Maneuver as a Free Action.
Bonus: The user may not be Intercepted, nor may any Abilities, Moves, or Features be activated to change the user’s target. Any of those existing effects (such as Follow Me) fail.
Ability: Punk Rock
Static
Effect: The user gains +2 DB to moves that have the Sonic keyword.
Bonus: The user resists moves with the Sonic keyword one step further. Defensive.
Ability: Quick Draw
Scene – Free Action, Interrupt
Trigger: A foe uses a Move, and the user has not acted this round
Effect: The user immediately uses a Move on the triggering foe as a Standard Action Interrupt (this Move must still obey Frequency and Range). If this Move hits, the foe also gains a -2 penalty to their attack roll for the triggering attack, unless the foe cannot Flinch.
Bonus: The user cannot be Flinched. Defensive.
Ability: Ripen
Static
Effect: Any numeric benefits of Berry Food Buffs the user trades in are doubled. (Oran Berries restore 10 HP, Liechi increases Attack by +2 CS, Jaboca causes ¼ Hit Point loss, Occa Weakens a Move 2 stages, etc.). This does not increase the number of statuses cured, Scene Moves restored, stats lowered by suppressants, or allow triggering at double the usual HP one must be at.
Ability: Sand Spit
Scene – Free Action, Reaction
Trigger: The user is damaged by an attack from a foe within 2m
Effect: Connection – Sand Attack. The user attacks the triggering foe with Sand Attack as a Free Action.
Ability: Screen Cleaner
Daily – Standard Action
Effect: All Blessings on the field, both ally and enemy, are removed.
Bonus: The user is immune to non-Blocking Hazards, and destroys them when moving over them. Blocking Hazards are treated instead as Slow Terrain for the purposes of movement only (the user may still not target through them), and are destroyed if moved through.
Ability: Splendorous Rider
Scene x2 – Swift Action
Effect: The user may pick a Move from their Mount’s known Moves that they do not already know. For the rest of the user’s Turn, they may use that Move as though it was one of their own Moves. Note that this does not remove any frequency limitations – a Daily Move that the Mount knows may not be used more than once.
This Ability may not be copied or transferred.
Ability: Stalwart
Scene – Free Action, Reaction
Trigger: The user receives Massive Damage
Effect: The user’s Attack, Special Attack, Defense, and Special Defense all increase by 1 CS.

Ability: Steam Engine
Scene x2 – Swift Action, Reaction
Trigger: The user is hit by a damaging Fire-Type or Water-Type Move, or begins their turn in Rainy Weather
Effect: Connection – Smokescreen. The user may use Smokescreen as a Free Action, ignoring frequency, centered on the user.
Ability: Transistor
Scene x2 – Free Action
Trigger: The user hits with a damaging Electric-Type Move
Effect: One target hit by the attack becomes one stage more vulnerable to the attack (applied after all other modifiers). Immune targets are treated as initially double-resistant for the purposes of this Ability, and may be damaged normally.
Ability: Unseen Fist
Static
Effect: Reactions, Interrupts, and Blessings may not be activated in response to the user’s Melee Attacks.
